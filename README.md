## State of the project
- PCBs are fully working (OLED, LEDs, all switches, encoders, Trackball)
- acrylic plates are ordered and soon to be tested
- for the upper encoder you can't use the really big guitar knobs as they're to wide and will interfere with the OLEDs. The smaller ones are recommended
