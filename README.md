This is a 34-36-key-board.
## Features
- 36 keys, two of them can be replaced by rotary encoders making it support 34-36 keys and 2-4 encoders. 
- bright RGB Underglow with ws2812b LEDs
- one ssd1306 OLED per side
- support for the [pimoroni trackball](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/trackball-breakout)
- powered by QMK-firmware (Firmware has been merged and can be found on [the qmk master](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/))
- aggressive pinky stagger similar to the kyria but with an alternative thumb cluster to raise comfort for large hands
- support for mx and choc switches
- files for fr4 plate and acrylic bottom plate as well as OLED window

## State of the project
- PCBs are fully working (OLED, LEDs, all switches, encoders, Trackball)
- acrylic plates have arrived and fit perfectly
- for the upper encoder you can't use the really big guitar knobs as they're to wide and will interfere with the OLEDs. The smaller ones are recommended
- 3D-printable case has been added thanks to the awesome work of Sadek Baroudi
- basic ZMK Firmware (not all features implemented yet) exists on [my fork of the zmk firmware](https://github.com/MangoIV/zmk.git)

## Plans for the future
- currently everything I wanted seems to be implemented
## Hardware availability
- Hardware availability is always a big problem and ordering everything yourself is a big hustle. Therefore I'm happy to tell your that [keycapsss offers everything to make a full build](https://keycapsss.com/)
