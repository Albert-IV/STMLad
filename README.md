# dracuLad
This is a 34-36-key-board.
## Features
- 36 keys, two of them can be replaced by rotary encoders making it support 34-36 keys and 2-4 encoders. 
- bright RGB Underglow with ws2812b LEDs
- one ssd1306 OLED per side
- support for the [pimoroni trackball](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/trackball-breakout)
- powered by QMK-firmware (Firmware can be found at [my fork of the qmk firmware with branch "draculad"](https://github.com/MangoIV/qmk_firmware/tree/draculad))
- aggressive pinky stagger similar to the kyria but with an alternative thumb cluster to raise comfort for large hands
- support for mx and choc switches
- files for fr4 plate and acrylic bottom plate as well as OLED window

## State of the project
- PCBs are fully working (OLED, LEDs, all switches, encoders, Trackball)
- acrylic plates have arrived and fit perfectly
- for the upper encoder you can't use the really big guitar knobs as they're to wide and will interfere with the OLEDs. The smaller ones are recommended
