# DracuLad Build guide
## What you need
- 2x pcbs
- 2x bottom plate, 2x top plate, 2x OLED cover (of course they're optional, especially when building the choc version)
- 34-36 Switches, either choc low profile v1 or mx compatible ones
- 2-4 rotary encoders (e.g. if you choose to build with 3 rotaries, you would only need 35 switches)
- 2x pro micro compatible controllers
- 20x ws2812b LEDs (if you want underglow)
- 38x sod123 SMD diodes
- 2x reset switches (they're also optional, you could alway just reset with tweezers or from the firmware)
- 2x SSD1306 OLEDs, those are optional as well
- 1x pimoroni trackball (optional)
- 2x TRRS jacks
- 8x 0.7cm standoffs, 16 m2 screws to mount the case 
- 6x standoffs with m2 screws for the OLED cover (standoff size depends on whether you use the OLEDs or not and probably also how low profile your pro micro is mounted (bit-c for example is a bit higher profile), with OLEDs 1cm is ok)
- usb cable, trrs cable, rotary encoder knobs, keycaps
